### Sawhorse Construction - Part 1: Making Sawdust!

#### The Plan

Every good project starts with a plan, and mine is... a bit of a sketch. Literally. Below is a picture of the initial design I put together.

I'm still debating whether to use round or square pegs for the joinery.

#### Raw Materials

I’ve chosen poplar for this build. It's soft enough to work by hand and available at my local lumberyard. Here’s the slab I brought home, just waiting to become a sawhorse:

Starting to play with these Japanese saws:

#### Preparing the Wood

Just like I described in the [first post](link-to-post), I started by jointing and planing the poplar. Here's a look at some of the pieces after dimensioning:

To reach the 4 inches needed for the top beam, I glued two smaller boards together. Poplar glues up well and should be solid enough for the weight it’ll carry.

#### Starting the Joinery

With the wood prepared, I got to work marking everything using my trusty marking gauge and square.

Then I started cutting the tenons using my Japanese saws.

Once the cuts were done, I cleaned them up with a chisel until I had a clean, satisfying tenon.

Next, I started cutting the mortises in the top beam. These were chopped directly with a chisel, no drill used here. Just hammer, patience, and a bit of muscle.

#### Mid-Leg Joinery

After the top joinery, I moved on to the middle mortises in the legs. These will later hold the braces that keep the sawhorse from wobbling.

#### What’s Next?

That’s all for this part! Next time, I’ll finish the legs and braces. I’ve already marked them up:

Still haven’t decided between round or square pegs to hold everything together, but I’m leaning toward using **walnut** for contrast against the pale poplar. It’s going to look sharp.

Stay tuned!
